    这篇文章探讨了瑞典人的性格与酒精的微妙关系，过程中也透露了我对瑞典人嗜酒的诧异与不解。不过我相信即使文化不同，表面上的行为不同，来自五湖四海的人还是可以成为朋友；决定不同国家的人是否能成为朋友，个体差异的作用大于文化差异。纯属杂谈随感，语言也颇口语化，读者毋要认真。因为文章原始发发布求英文，而最近忙于考试未能来得及翻译，如给部分读者带来不便，还请见谅.

      In the culture where I grew up, people are curious about foreigners. I have been a foreigner in Sweden <em>since</em> Aug 2010. And I remain  curious about the world around me, even though I&#8217;ve been here more than one year, it&#8217;s<em> </em>still new to me. I‘m going to tell you several things which I don&#8217;t understand about Sweden 😀 <strong>It is interesting to explain why, but at the same time avoid<em> giving </em>a &#8216;right&#8217; answer.</strong>

        1. People become very happy to talk to you when they have a glass of beer or wine&#8230;and I once asked a Swedish friend why it is like that, he said &#8220;because we feel relaxed&#8221;
      </p>
      
      <p align="left">
        I was kind of surprised by his answer. So, they don&#8217;t feel relaxed without alcohol?
      </p>

        I cannot understand, absolutely not, because I felt nervous and my heart beat quite quickly when I drank alcohol. During my first year in Sweden I had the most chances(ever in my life) to drink, and most of the time I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable, so I just quit drinking<em> </em>last summer (but the most important reason or that is Buddhism)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So, I suppose have no opportunity to figure out why Swedes feel relaxed when they drink anymore 😛

        2. Yes, most Swedes I&#8217;ve ever talked with, if you agree, I think they are quite shy. But on average girls are easier to talk with than boys. Maybe I&#8217;m more shy than them,so they are very polite and gentle when they are talking with a nervous Chinese girl, hahaha. This behavior doesn&#8217;t seem natural for them, maybe they are changing for me?  However, what makes me happy is that I have some awesome Swedish friends, they are not like the &#8220;traditional&#8221; Swedes who are shy and nervous, even without any drinks!

        One thing is, I think the most important reason that it is hard to communicate with some people is, maybe, language skills. I always want to speak more than that I actually do. The second important reason is the difference. Notably, it is not cultural difference here, because I do have some good friends from different backgrounds, and some &#8216;hi-bye&#8217; Chinese friends though we are from a common culture. Maybe the values you believe in, the things you focus on are all factors which have influence, and I think they overcome the so-called culture difference, the difference between individuals are more significant than the difference between cultures.
